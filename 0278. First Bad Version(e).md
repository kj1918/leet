You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
 ```

Constraints:  
  
```1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1```
  
標準的二元搜尋，但要注意邊界的問題，左右pointer要改去哪邊  
第二點是 ``mid = left + (right - left) / 2;``，這樣寫是因為直接``mid = left + right``有可能會超過INT_MAX(2^31 - 1)，改成這寫法才能避免超過。  

  
```c
// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int mid;
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        if (n == 1)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        while (left < right)
        {
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (isBadVersion(mid))
            {
                right = mid;
            }
            else
            {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
            
        }
        return left;
    }
};
```
