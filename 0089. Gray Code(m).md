An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2n integers where:

Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2n - 1],
The first integer is 0,
An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.
Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]
 ```

Constraints:  

``1 <= n <= 16``  
格雷碼儲存方式是採對稱的存，例如``n = 2``就是把``n = 1``的結果顛倒再弄一次：
```
0
1
```
變成
```
00
01
11
10
```
可以看到最右邊``0-1-1-0``的變化，依此類推``n = 3``
```
000
001
011
010
110
111
101
100
```
這次可以觀察到``00-01-11-10-10-11-01-00``的變化，只是前方加上0跟1
```c
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> re;
        int amount=pow(2,n);
        re.resize(amount);
        re[0]=0;
        for(int i=0;i<amount-1;i++){
            if(i%2==1){//i is even [1] is no.2
                int exp=0,temp=re[i];
                while(temp%2==0){//find the first 1 from right
                    temp/=2;
                    exp++;
                }
                temp/=2;
                if(temp%2==0){//then change the bit in it left
                    re[i+1]=(temp+1)*2;
                    re[i+1]++;
                    re[i+1]*=pow(2,exp);
                }
                else{
                    re[i+1]=(temp-1)*2;
                    re[i+1]++;
                    re[i+1]*=pow(2,exp);
                }
            }
            else{//i is odd
                if(re[i]%2==0){//re[i] is even
                    re[i+1]=re[i]+1;
                }
                else{//re[i] is odd
                    re[i+1]=re[i]-1;
                }
                
            }
        }
        return re;
    }
};

```
另外格雷碼有公式，保留最左邊bit，剩下的XOR自己的上(左)一位數，可表示為i^(i>>1)，程式碼可改為
```c
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        int end = 1 << n;
        vector<int> result;
        result.resize(end);
        for (int i=0; i<end; i++)
        {
            result[i] = i ^ (i >> 1);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
