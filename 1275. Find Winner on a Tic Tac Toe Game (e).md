Tic-tac-toe is played by two players ``A`` and ``B`` on a ``3 x 3`` grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:

Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ``' '``.
The first player ``A`` always places ``'X'`` characters, while the second player ``B`` always places ``'O'`` characters.  
``'X'`` and ``'O'`` characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.  
The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.  
The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.  
No more moves can be played if the game is over.  
  
Given a 2D integer array moves where ``moves[i] = [rowi, coli]`` indicates that the ith move will be played on ``grid[rowi][coli]``. return the winner of the game if it exists (``A`` or ``B``). In case the game ends in a draw return ``"Draw"``. If there are still movements to play return ``"Pending"``.  

You can assume that ``moves`` is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is initially empty, and ``A`` will play first.  
   
 
  
Example 1:

```
Input: moves = [[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: "A"
Explanation: A wins, they always play first.
```
Example 2:
```

Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]]
Output: "B"
Explanation: B wins.
```
Example 3:
```

Input: moves = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2],[2,2]]
Output: "Draw"
Explanation: The game ends in a draw since there are no moves to make.
 ```

Constraints:  
  
``1 <= moves.length <= 9``  
``moves[i].length == 2``  
``0 <= rowi, coli <= 2``  
There are no repeated elements on moves.  
moves follow the rules of tic tac toe.

將勝利條件設定為8種情況，三條直的，三條橫的，兩條對角線，獎每個move讀入，根據情況將對應勝利條件+1，最後檢查是否存在符合勝利條件的(該條件有3顆)回傳。
