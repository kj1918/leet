Given an array of points where ``points[i] = [xi, yi]`` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer ``k``, return the ``k`` closest points to the origin ``(0, 0)``.

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., ``√(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2``).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).  
Example 1:
```

Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```
Example 2:
```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
 ```

Constraints:  

``1 <= k <= points.length <= 104``
``-104 < xi, yi < 104``
  
使用priority_queue，保持只有k個元素，pop會扔掉具有最大值的元素，這邊把距離排在vector的第一個，所以就是距離最大的丟掉，保持最近的。
```c
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> kClosest(vector<vector<int>>& points, int k) {
        vector<vector<int>> result;
        priority_queue<vector<int>> locHeap;
        int n = points.size();
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            int x = points[i][0], y = points[i][1];
            locHeap.push({(x * x) + (y * y), x, y});
            if (locHeap.size() > k)
            {
                locHeap.pop();
            }
        }
        n = locHeap.size();
        result.resize(n);
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
        {
            vector<int> locElement = locHeap.top();
            result[i] = {locElement[1], locElement[2]};
            locHeap.pop();
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
